Project Name: UDA_Capstone

Description:
This project was done as the capstone project for my Data Analytics and Business Intelligence program. The end report shows how much energy each of the 26 houses consumes and the best upgrade each house can do to save them the most amount of money. 

Steps:
I first took unstructured data and turned it into structured data by inputting the data into Microsoft Excel. I cleaned the data using Power Query and made visualizations in Power BI. I created a PDF copy and then created a report on Microsoft Word answering project questions and outlining the potenial savings.
